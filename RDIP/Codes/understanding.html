IMPORTANT POINTS:
1. Tokens are the number of words that are present in a sentence
2. Types are the number of unique or unrepeated words that are present in a sentence
3. After answering the number of tokens and types I feel that the tokens and types need to be highlighted
4. If the submitted answer is wrong the answered box need to turn red and should print "Wrong answer"
5. If the submitted answer is correct then the answered box need to turn green and should print "Right answer"
6. If it is a wrong answer the user can know the answer if the text are highlighted based on tokens and types with different colours.
7. The paragraph or sentences should change randomly everytime
8. In order to avoid confusion in counting the number of types there need to be an option to highlight the repeated word.
9. The submit button need to check and give the answers of both number of types and tokens at the same time.
10. Finally the website should always be responsive.
